Especially when documenting, consistency is really useful. Sometimes even with only one author it's easy to forget conventions, so here's a few notes:

# Documentation Conventions<a id="sec-1"></a>

-   capitalization
    -   [ ] title-case titles and first-level headers
    -   [ ] first-letter capitalize lower headers

-   [ ] use “…” in pseudocode instead of “&#x2026;” to help disambiguate
-   [ ] consistency of syntax
    -   ‘~’ code
        -   variable names
    -   ‘/’ italics
        -   new concepts
