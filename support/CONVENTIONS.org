#+TITLE: Conventions for Project

Especially when documenting, consistency is really useful. Sometimes even with
only one author it's easy to forget conventions, so here's a few notes:

* Documentation Conventions

- capitalization
  - [ ] title-case titles and first-level headers
  - [ ] first-letter capitalize lower headers
- be aware that on GitHub first header is effectively the title
- [ ] use “…” in pseudocode instead of “...” to help disambiguate
- [ ] consistency of syntax
  - plain
    - official program names
  - ‘/’ italics
    - new concepts
  - ‘~’ code (inlined snippets of code)
    - primitive literals
    - code expressions (intrinsically anonymous)
    - usage of switches of CLI tools (intrinsically anonymous)
  - ‘=’ verbatim (nouns with names that are code-like)
    - keywords
    - function names
    - attributes of sets
    - attribute paths
    - command line tool names (possibly including a subcommand)
    - variable name
    - name of a CLI switch
    - environment paths
    - filepaths
    - layers
