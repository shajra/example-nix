* About This Project

  This project illustrates using [[nix][the Nix package manager]] for programming
  heterogeneous, multi-module projects. Notably, it provides [[./pkgs-make/README.org][a Nix library
  called Pkgs-make]] to save some the boilerplate we might have to write when
  using Nix for managing a software lifecycle. Pkgs-make currently directly
  supports [[haskell][Haskell]] and [[python][Python]] development, but has the potential to support
  other language platforms.

  Use this project to learn and explore what's possible. It's set up for
  pedagogy, but you should be able to use Pkgs-make in real projects (a group
  of us does). There are many ways to organize code, and the beauty of Nix is
  that it's very flexible. So use Pkgs-make if you can, but be aware that
  there's many ways to achieve the same goal, and your needs will determine
  what's best.

* Navigating This Repository

  We've tried hard to keep the code clean and self-documenting. Here's a survey
  of the project's layout with some links, each with their own README files
  explaining more:

  | File/Directory         | Description                                        |

  | [[./tutorials/1-pkgs-make][tutorials/1-pkgs-make/]] | tutorial of basic Pkgs-make usage                  |
  | [[./tutorials/2-haskell][tutorials/2-haskell/]]   | tutorial of Haskell example using Pkgs-make        |
  | [[./tutorials/2-python][tutorials/2-python/]]    | tutorial of Python example using Pkgs-make         |
  | [[./tools][tools/]]                 | tool configuration for a nice developer experience |
  | [[./run][run/]]                   | scripts to illustrate this project                 |
  | [[./pkgs-make][pkgs-make/]]             | Pkgs-make, the Nix library driving this project    |

  The links are presented in loose recommended reading order, starting with
  tutorials on usage, and ending with the implementation of Pkgs-make. If you
  don't know what Nix is or the motivation to use it over the alternatives, the
  first tutorial is a good place to start.

  If you don't have a preferred Markdown or Org-mode viewer, we recommend just
  using Github's Markdown rendering at https://github.com/shajra/example-nix.

* Prerequisites

** Knowledge

   We've tried to make this project explanatory enough that you don't need to
   read external references first. But covering Nix in its entirety is beyond
   the scope of this project, so it's really good to have the official
   documentation available for reference:

   - [[nix-manual][Nix Manual]]
   - [[nixpkgs-manual][Nixpkgs Manual]]

   There are also [[nix-tutorials][many good tutorials]]. Here are few that some of us have found
   useful personally:

   - [[haskell-nix][Gabriel Gonzalez's haskell-nix]]
   - [[nix-pills][Luca Bruno's "pill" series]]
   - [[wiegley][John Wiegley's Haskell/Nix talk]]

** Technology

*** Nix

      Because this project is really about Nix, you should have [[nix-install][the Nix package
      manager installed]].

      Unless you're running NixOS as your operating system (which provides Nix
      intrinsically) the primary way to install Nix on another operating system
      is by running Nix's install script:

      #+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no
        curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
      #+END_SRC

      Also, be aware that this project is actively tested on a GNU/Linux OS, and
      only loosely tested on Macs. Nix support for Macs is always improving, but
      is known to be idiosyncratic.

      If for some reason you can't install Nix, we can still use [[docker][Docker]] to
      build some of the projects in the tutorials. We just won't be able to
      showcase development tools without Nix installed on the host system.

*** Docker

      This project illustrates how to build and package up applications in
      Docker.

      See the [[docker-install][Docker installation guide]] for instructions on how to install Docker
      for your system.

*** Additional developers tools

      This project also provides some [[./tools][configuration for some developers tools]] for
      a nice Nix-based developer experience with this project. Some of us have
      used these tools on real projects, and we've been pleased with the results.

*** Things you don't need to install

    Beyond Docker and these developer tools, you don't need to install
    language-specific tooling like interpreters/compilers, build systems, or
    static analysis tools.

    Once you have Nix, we can use it as a bootstrap to get all the other tools
    you might need that are more likely to vary from project to project.
    Pkgs-make can help with this.

* Feedback Desired

  If you have an idea to improve this project's documentation or features,
  please submit an issue or pull request. Otherwise, feel free to fork/modify
  it.

  This repository has been around for a few years, but we've not yet officially
  released it to allow it some time to get some heavier refactoring. If you're
  please interested, please leave an issue suggesting so, and we can take the
  necessary steps.
