#+TITLE: Tutorial Run Scripts
#+SETUPFILE: ../support/links.org

Three tutorials provide accompanying code that can be run as discussed in their
respective README files:

- [[../tutorials/1-pkgs-make][1-pkgs-make]] (a shell program)
- [[../tutorials/2-haskell][2-haskell]]
- [[../tutorials/2-python][2-python]]

These programs are simple and just output a message to the terminal.

There are four “run-” scripts in this directory that you can run if you have
Nix installed. Each takes as a single argument either “shell”, “haskell”, or
“python” to call the respective tutorial.

Here's a description of the four scripts:

- =run-native= :: runs the program with Nix alone (no Docker involved)

- =run-docker-image= ::
     builds a Docker image with Nix and runs it with Docker

- =run-docker-tarball= ::
     builds tarball with Nix which is built into a Docker image and run with
     Docker

- =run-licences= :: prints a license report with Nix alone (no Docker involved)

If you don't have Nix installed locally, we can do the Nix work within a
Nix-imaged Docker container. Just pass the command you want to run as arguments
to the provided =docker-nix= script. For instance:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no
  ./docker-nix run-docker-image haskell
#+END_SRC

We tried to keep the code clean, so you may find that you can pick up a lot
from reading these scripts, the code in the tutorials, and the Pkgs-make code.
