#+TITLE: Things To Do

* Prioritized

- "run" work
  - reread/edit tutorials first for prior context
  - amend run/README.org
- implement unit tests with BATS
- reread/edit all docs
  - use no-web to set up NIX_PATH and NIX_PROFILE (less ":eval no" blocks)
  - finish copying from nix.org
  - pure-Nix doc-generation (remove GC in docs)
  - switch to new nix-haskell-tags
- Pkgs-make
  - explain curated? Or silently ignore?
- rename GitHub example-nix -> nix-package
- CI/Cachix should cache env-tools
- direnvrc
  - special touch file for cache invalidation (.direnv/touch)
  - optional content hashing
  - try to get adopted by nix-direnv
- how to make unified Haddocks in Nix?
- Attrap
  - does `refactor` work?
  - is `refactor` backwards compatible with old GHC versions?
- make a real install script?
- Figure out a license

* Ideas (not critical)

- Contributor documentation somewhere
- C tutorial to explain stdenv.mkDerivation?
- break up long tutorials?
