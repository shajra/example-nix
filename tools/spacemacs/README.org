* About Nix-configuration for Spacemacs

  This is an editor configuration some of us have used professionally for a
  while now, so we feel it's vetted enough to share. There may be other ways to
  configure other editors. This is just the best way we've found.

** A Small Pitch

   The [[spacemacs][Spacemacs]] project is just an opinionated configuration for [[emacs][GNU Emacs]]. We
   like the Spacemacs project because it has a very good user experience that
   provides easier discovery of features for beginners, but doesn't hamper the
   full expressiveness of Emacs. Also, though Spacemacs does have a lot of code
   beyond what's provided by plain Emacs, it's not all turned on at once. Even
   if you enable a lot of Spacemacs layers, they are often lazily loaded upon
   first use.

   Most importantly, Spacemacs code is well-factored. When first picking up
   Emacs, a lot of people don't know good packages to try out. And as they find
   them, it's not at all clear how to best organize the Emacs Lisp code that
   configures Emacs. A lot of people end up with a very long and twisted
   =~/.emacs.d/init.el= file.

   Because Spacemacs code is modular, it makes it easier to share our Emacs
   configuration in a pluggable way that's more declarative and plays into the
   design decisions of the Spacemacs project that we like.

* Installation

  To start with, you need to install Emacs and then Spacemacs. To install
  Spacemacs, Git is recommended.

  Install Emacs with a package manager (Brew, Apt, Nix, etc.) apropos for your
  operating system.

  Then, assuming you don't yet have an Emacs configuration under =~/.emacs.d=,
  clone the Spacemacs repository with Git to be your Emacs configuration:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no
     git clone --branch develop https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
  #+END_SRC

  The configuration provided only works with the more cutting edge "develop"
  branch of Spacemacs. The "master" branch, though the official stable branch,
  has not been released in some time and is missing a lot of useful
  improvements.

  If you do have an Emacs configuration already, save/move it off to a
  temporary location first.

  You can now invoke =emacs= and get the default Spacemacs experience.

* Configuration

  Spacemacs is extensible with what they call /layers/. This repository
  distributes five layers. Each is documented individually:

  - [[./private/extn-spacemacs/README.org][Extn-Spacemacs]]
  - [[./private/extn-haskell/README.org][Extn-Haskell]]
  - [[./private/extn-python/README.org][Extn-Python]]
  - [[./private/attrap/README.org][Attrap]]
  - [[./private/direnv/README.org][Direnv]]

  If you use all of these layers, you can use the provided example Spacemacs
  configuration files =dotfile.spacemacs.el= and =dotfile.spacemacs.static.el=,
  which you can copy or link to the following destinations:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no
    cp dotfile.spacemacs.el ~/.spacemacs
    cp dotfile.spacemacs.static.el ~/.spacemacs.static.el
  #+END_SRC

  If you are already using Spacemacs and have your =.spacemacs= file
  configured, you can look at these files to see how to best integrate these
  configurations into what you have. Or move what you have to a temporary
  location and try what's provided unaltered.
